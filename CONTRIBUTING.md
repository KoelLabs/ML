# Contributing to Koel Labs - Machine Learning
üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

Our goal is to train diverse, noise-robust, multilingual models for pronunciation feedback that can run in realtime locally on consumer CPUs. We welcome all ideas from any backgrounds and are particularly open to partnerships with linguists, speech therapists, and language learners.

Checkout our [general contributing guidelines here](https://github.com/KoelLabs/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Where to Start

1. Read the [README.md](README.md) file to understand the purpose of this repository.
2. Read the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file to understand how to set up your local development environment. Important design decisions will also be documented here.
3. Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/KoelLabs/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct) to understand expectations while contributing to this project and take a look at the [FAQ](https://github.com/KoelLabs/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#faq) if you have any questions.
4. Read through the [issues](https://github.com/KoelLabs/ML/issues) to understand the current development priorities.
5. We want to foster open discussion and collaboration. Feel free to open an issue to discuss early ideas or submit a pull request if you have a more concrete proposal. Training code should run locally for smaller data samples in order to be merged in. We will use our GPUs to run it on full datasets and release the results.
