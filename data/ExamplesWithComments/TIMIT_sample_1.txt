Ground Truth Text:
If you do, go to it.

Ground Truth Transcription:
hɪfjʉdʉuoʊtuɨt

- Debatable whether "go" should result in a "g" phoneme
- uses ʉ which is a close central rounded vowel

PKLumpp Result:
ɪfjʊduː(...)gəʊtəɪt(...)

- uses ʊ instead which is near-close near-back rounded vowel

Facebook 60 XLSR Result:
f j uː d uː ɡ oʊ t uː ɪ t

- misses the first "ɪ" vowel
- identify lots of vowels as prolonged "uː" sounds, we can probably adjust "ː" detection using timestamps 
- uses tense "u", clearly some ambiguity in IPA spelling
